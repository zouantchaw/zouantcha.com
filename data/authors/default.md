Wiel Zouantcha is a proficient software developer, with experience in Blockchain and Frontend development.

He is currently under contract with [ethos](https://www.ethosnft.com/), where his responsibilities involve developing smart contracts for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) aimed at brands operating on various blockchains such as Ethereum and Flow. In this capacity, he has been instrumental in developing a robust internal API service that seamlessly interfaces with the Flow blockchain. This API enables developers to perform tasks such as programmatic deployment of Flow standard NFT contracts, asset minting, and transfers from these deployed contracts. In addition, he engineered an advanced internal API service that communicates effectively with both the Ethereum blockchain and Polygon, a Layer 2 scaling solution.

Prior to his contract with ethos, Wiel served as a Frontend Developer at [SaaSAlerts](https://saasalerts.com/). In this role, he was tasked with building responsive and intuitive frontend interfaces for the development of security monitoring tools for Managed Service Providers (MSPs). He conducted in-depth research on both internal and external APIs to uncover opportunities for enhancing product functionality and ensuring seamless integration with third-party applications like Microsoft, Google, and Dropbox. Additionally, he was responsible for creating detailed API documentation to foster efficient collaboration and product improvements among internal teams and external developers.
