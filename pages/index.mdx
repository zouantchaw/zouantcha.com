## Hi, I'm Wiel 👋🏾

I'm a software developer, optimist, and family man. I currently [work](/work) as a full stack developer at [ethos](https://www.heyethos.com/) where I help build the future of customer loyalty.

When I'm not coding, I'm most likely [reading](/blog/books-read-2022), training, or spending time with family and friends.
