### bene

<span style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "smaller" }}>
  Tool for managing and renting out items in your inventory.
</span>

[Bene](https://app.rentbene.com/login) was born out of a need my brother and I identified for a streamlined way to manage and lease our party/event equipment. Our main goals were to effortlessly monitor which items were with whom and when they were expected to return. Additionally, we required a dedicated platform for facilitating the rental process of our gear. To address these challenges, I developed Bene, which is based on the [Vercel Platform Starter Kit](https://github.com/vercel/platforms). It incorporates Next.js and Prisma as the ORM, with Vercel providing the hosting solution.

### mtlarchives

<span style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "smaller" }}>
  A collection of old photos of Montreal.
</span>

Discovering the [Montreal Open Data](https://donnees.montreal.ca/) portal led me to a treasure trove of historical Montreal photographs. Leveraging this dataset, I launched an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mtlarchives/) account dedicated to sharing these glimpses of the past, which is now on the verge of reaching **3000** followers. Additionally, I developed a [landing page](http://archives-landing-page-v1.vercel.app/) aimed at expanding an email subscriber base interested in this project.
