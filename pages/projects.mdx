### bene

<span style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "smaller" }}>
  Tool for managing and renting out items in your inventory.
</span>

[Bene](https://app.rentbene.com/login) arose from me and my brother wanting a solution to easily manage and rent out our party/event equipment. We wanted to be able to easily keep track of who has what, and when it's due back. We also needed a rental site to be able to rent out our equipment. I built Bene to help us solve these problems. Bene is a fork of the [Vercel Platform Starter Kit](https://github.com/vercel/platforms). It uses Next.js, Prisma, and Vercel for hosting.

### mtlarchives

<span style={{ color: "grey", fontSize: "smaller" }}>
  A collection of old photos of Montreal.
</span>

I stumbled upon the [Montreal Open Data](https://donnees.montreal.ca/) portal and found a dataset of old photos of Montreal. I decided to use the photos from the data set to create an [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mtlarchives/) audience. The account is nearing **3000** unique followers. I also created a [landing page](http://archives-landing-page-v1.vercel.app/) for the project with the goal of growing an email list of people interested in the project.
