I joined [ethos](https://heyethos.com) at an early stage, initially contributing as a blockchain developer before transitioning into a full-stack developer role. Throughout my tenure, I've worked on several projects, such as:
- Developing our [onchain](https://basehub.org/docs/getting-started/what-is-onchain/) infrastructure to enable interaction with Ethereum and its Layer 2 ecosystem.
- Developing our Shopify app and extension, enabling our users to integrate their Shopify stores with our platform.
- Leading the frontend development of our admin dashboard, incorporating [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to enhance our frontend development, alongside [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), a bespoke UI library for crafting our UI components.

### SaaSAlerts

[SaaSAlerts](https://saasalerts.com) is security monitoring platform for [MSPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_services). During my time at SaaSAlerts, I gained my first production experience with React and Typescript. I worked on the frontend to help our users better understand data inflows from services like AWS, Azure, GCP, ITGlue, Kibana, and more. I also worked on internal and external documentation of the product.
